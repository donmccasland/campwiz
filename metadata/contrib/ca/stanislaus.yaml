    name: Frank Raines Regional Park
    desc:  Frank Raines Regional Park offers the rugged slopes of Californiaâ€™s Coast Range and is functionally divided into three units, separated by several miles of road. The Minniear Area encompasses over 1,000 acres of undeveloped land designed for non-motorized recreation use. The Frank Raines Day Use Area provides picnic tables, barbecues, a themed playground, and more. And for campers and OHV enthusiasts, the Frank Raines Off-Highway Vehicle Park is located across from the Day Use Area.
